If you are like me, you joined the [CU CSPB program](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/academics/online-programs/bachelor-science-applied-computer-science-post-baccalaureate) seeking new opportunities. Perhaps your career wasn't going the way you anticipated or you foresaw a great deal of uncertainty on the horizon on your current path. Or on a more optimistic angle, you saw a CS degree as a way to gain the knowledge and skills to move to the next phase of your current career. 

Whatever the case may be, you have likely enjoyed some highs and lows in the program, gained a ton of information and learned new things about yourself.

In my first semester in the program, I was fortunate enough to share a few classes with Taylor, a student who was one semester ahead of me. Taylor had a goal of getting students involved with a Discord server that he had set up, where we could interface more easily with other students in the program. In my first semester, I interacted with it some, but as time progressed, I found it to be an indispesnable resource for several reasons:

1. It was an easy way to ask the dumb, remedial questions that felt too small for the ordained forum of the classes. Stuff like _when is this assignment due?_ or _are the lectures not loading for everyone else?_
1. It was a valuable resource to learn more about courses in the program. It was easy to ask other students what they had success with when taking multiple classes at once. Conversely, it gave a good idea of which classes to make room for due to their difficulty or time committment.
1. Lastly, and most importantly, it gave me an inside look at the other people in the program, their backgrounds and personalities, as well as what they saw for the future.

And let's face it - the future is scary. We all got into this as a way to create a better situation for ourselves, but with uncertainty all around us - slow recovery for the tech job market, AI making it easier to churn out code in minutes versus days, and a shaky political climate - it's hard to feel like what's waiting for us on the other side will be what we hoped it was.

I know that is quite gloomy, but I'm actually very optimistic about the opportunity in front of us. In the last 2 years, the economy has shifted from one that requires funding and resouces to build a company to an economy that rewards a small team of skilled founders with a passion for the product. This was the promise of Silicon Valley a decade ago and before, but Silicon Valley lost its way. In the last few years, the economy of Silicon Valley was focused around building "cute tech" - products and services that weren't actually helpful or unique, but were aimed at procuring funding, growing to a certain size and getting bought out by a larger competitor who viewed the product as a threat. There's no beauty to this and to be quite honest, I'm glad it's dead and hope it never comes back.

What's ahead of us is a more exciting future. It feels like we are going back to a consumer-needs based economy for products, where, if we can find our niche, we can live off the fat of that. I believe where we are heading is an economy where multi-thousand person companies will be harder and harder to justify, and it will be much easier using AI and peripheral-skills tools to build your own thing with a group of people who love it as much as you. No more company culture nonsense or getting stuck in heirarchy hell. Instead, it's you and your buds, interacting with each other like a band, writing and performing music, you are making products or services anyone can enjoy world-wide. Maybe this is what you do on the side, maybe this is your main thing.

Do I think every team to come out of Pan Out will have this degree of success? I _want_ to believe they will! But in reality, the most basic need this will fulfill for participants is a way to apply their CS learnings in a more day-to-day practice and have something tangible to show for their time in this program. I'm inspired by the backgrounds of my fellow students and I know that interfacing with them and working with them in a closer manner will bring good things to everyone.

Now note, this is our first attempt at Pan Out - there will be some bumps and things to figure out. So be patient and let us know if we forgot something. If you are interested in signing up, check the Discord server under the `#server-announcements` channel. If you don't have access to the Discord, [email me](mailto:beti7384@colorado.edu) with the subject line "Pan Out Discord Invite" from your colorado.edu email.

Looking forward to a great year and I can't wait to see what we come up with.
