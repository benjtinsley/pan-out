# Basic Guidelines


1. No prerequisite class necessary. You can be in your first semester and sign up.

1. Alumni welcome!

1. Orient around a remote-first culture. 

1. You will stay in the Pan Out Prepregistration Discord category until you complete the registration form where you a) specify your desired role and b) agree that any ideas shared in Pan Out belong to those who pitched the idea, or the team working on the idea.

1. Joining the discord server means you plan on pitching your own idea or participating in someone else's idea.

1. If you pitch an idea and it is not selected, you are still willing to work on someone else's idea. 

1. If you vote on ideas that do not have enough votes to form a team, you are still willing to work on a different idea.
