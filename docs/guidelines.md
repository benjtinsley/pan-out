# Basic Guidelines


1. No prerequisite class necessary. You can be in your first semester in the program and sign up.

1. Alumni welcome!

1. The `#pan-out` channel in the University of Colorado Post Bacc Discord server is hidden until you a) request to join and b) complete an NDA form agreeing that any ideas shared in Pan Out belong to those who pitched the idea, or the team working on the idea.

1. Joining the discord channel means you plan on pitching your own idea or participating in someone else's idea.

1. If you pitch an idea and it is not selected, you are still willing to work on someone else's idea. 

1. If you vote on ideas that do not have enough votes to form a team, you are still willing to work on a different idea.

1. The `#pan-out` channel in the University of Colorado Post Bacc Discord server is only for overall communications, demoes or announcements. It is not for team communications. Your team must find somewhere else to communicate as a group.
