# Pan Out Framework

## Purpose

Pan Out is a student-led inititiative to help all current or prior CU enrollees strike gold, by teaming up to build student-pitched products, applications or services, using the skills learned in the program to inspire and empower themselves and the world around them.

## How it Works

The second week of the Fall semester 2024, we will hold **Pan Out Pitches**, where students can pitch their ideas in a 5 minute presentation to their peers. All participants will have a chance to vote on their top 3 pitches. The pitches with enough votes will form a team based by interest and build the thing.

Once the teams are created, it's then up to them how they want to define requirements, make decisions, assign work and manage timelines. 

The first week of every semester following, we will check in with the teams, allowing them to give a 10 minute **Pan Out Demo** where each team can show off the progress they've made.

**Important Note**: While Pan Out is open for former or current CU students, it is not affiliated with the University of Colorado.

## How to Get Involved

Check the Pan Out Discord server. If you aren't a member, ask in Piazza if any other students in your classes can send you an invite. If that fails, [email BD](mailto:beti7384@colorado.edu) with the subject line "Pan Out Discord Invite" from your colorado.edu email. Emails from non colorado.edu domains will not be seen.
