# Pan Out Framework

## Purpose

Pan Out is a student-led inititiative to help all current or prior enrollees in CU's CSPB program strike gold, by teaming up to build student-pitched product, application or service ideas, using the skills learned in the program to inspire and empower themselves and the world around them.

## How it Works

The second week of the Fall semester, we will hold **Pan Out Pitches**, where students can pitch their ideas in a 5 minute presentation to their peers. All participants will have a chance to vote on their top 3 pitches and the ones with the most votes will team up based by interest and build the thing.

Once the teams are created, it's then up to them how they want to define requirements, make decisions, assign work and manage timelines. 

The first week of every semester following, we will check in with the teams, allowing them to give a 10 minute **Pan Out Demo** where each team can show off the progress they've made.

**Important Note**: While Pan Out is open for former or current students in CU's CSPB program, it is not affiliated with the University of Colorado.

## How to Get Involved

Check the University of Colorado Post Bacc Discord server. If you aren't a member, ask in Piazza if any other students in your classes can send you an invite. If that fails, [email BD](mailto:beti7384@colorado.edu) with the subject line "Pan Out Discord Invite" from your colorado.edu email. Emails from non colorado.edu domains will not be seen.

**Another Important Note**: while the University of Colorado Post Bacc Discord server is the entry point into Pan Out, it's not where your team will collaborate! Your team will determine the best route for communication and tracking.
